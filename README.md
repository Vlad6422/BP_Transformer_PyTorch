## üìù Project Description  
This bachelor's thesis introduces chatbot development, explaining how different architectures work and how to create your own chatbot using **PyTorch**. The project covers both **retrieval-based models** (simpler, rule-based chatbots) and **transformer-based models** (such as GPT-2 and LLaMA).

By following this work, users will learn how to implement a chatbot using **PyTorch**, train models on different datasets, and experiment with both basic and advanced architectures.  

### Key Features:  
- Implementation of **retrieval-based** and **transformer-based** chatbots using PyTorch.  
- Customizable training pipelines for fine-tuning transformer models.  
- Support for training on different datasets.  
- Pre-provided datasets for both **open-domain** conversations and a **medical chatbot**.  

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand chatbot development and build their own AI-powered assistant using **PyTorch**. üöÄ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url] && cd Chatbot-Based-On-Deep-Neural-Networks
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Key packages*: `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `numpy`, `tqdm`.  

3. Download pre-trained weights (e.g., GPT-2) and place them in the `Pretrained/` directory.

## üöÄ Usage  
1. **Training**:  
   Configure hyperparameters in `config.json` and run:  
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.json
   ```
2. **Interactive Chat**:  
   Start the chatbot with a pre-trained model:  
   ```bash
   python chat.py --model gpt2 --temperature 0.7
   ```
   *(Adjust `--model` and `--temperature` as needed.)*  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   Compute metrics using:  
   ```bash
   python metrics.py --dataset test_data.jsonl
   ```
